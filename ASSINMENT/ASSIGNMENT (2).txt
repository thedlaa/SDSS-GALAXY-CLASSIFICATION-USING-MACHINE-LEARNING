1.DEFINE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE(AI) AND PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF ITS APPLICATIONS?

A.Artificial intelligence (AI) is defined as a digital machine’s capability to perform cognitive-like functions typically associated with intelligent beings. This includes interacting with their environments, solving problems, deducing facts, forecasting, offering suggestions and performing complex calculations.

Most of today’s advanced AI models are self-learning, meaning that they have the ability to iteratively improve on themselves through feedback loops. Others that are only just evolving have the ability to generate text, audio, video, code — even music and art thought previously to be solely the domain of humans. This is known as generative AI (genAI).?
Types of AI

Based on current functionalities, AI fits into four general categories:

    Reactive AI
    Limited-memory AI
    Theory of mind AI
    Self-aware AI

Reactive AI — also referred to as narrow AI or weak AI — is the first generation of AI. These models can suitably perform one specific task, often better than human beings, but do not learn over time. As American philosopher John Searle described it, this technology is “useful for testing hypotheses about minds, but would not actually be minds.”

Limited-memory AI can learn from the past and incorporate those learnings back into its algorithms to improve itself over time. These models use historical, preprogrammed data and observational data to make predictions and perform classification and other tasks. Machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning, is the classic example of this.

Theory-of-mind AI and self-aware AI have yet to be realized. With theory of mind, machines would have decision-making abilities similar to humans and could adjust their behavior to interact with people and respond to new situations. Self-aware AI would take that a step further to achieve true sentience and consciousness. These types of theoretical AIs are often referred to as artificial general intelligence (AGI) and artificial super intellige.

APPLICATIONS OF AI

   -> Data analysis, including large amounts of data that is collected but otherwise ignored (what                 
    knows as dark data).
   -> Predictive analytics and DataOps to identify trends and patterns.
  ->  Recommendation engines to target relevant products and services to customers/consumers.
  ->  Sentiment analysis to identify and categorize customer feedback.
   -> Customer support (chatbots and aggregation of previous customer interactions).
   -> Security and risk management.
   -> Network optimization in telecommunications.
   -> Application performance management (APM).
   -> Marketing management.
   -> Supply-chain planning, management and maintenance.

2.DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN SUPERVISED AND UNSUPERVISED LEARNINGTECHNIQUES IN ML?

A: differences between supervised and unsupervised learning techniques in Machine Learning (ML):

Supervised Learning:

Definition: In supervised learning, an algorithm is trained on a labelled dataset. This means that the input data used for training is paired with corresponding output labels.
Objective: The goal is to find a mapping or relationship between the input variables and the desired output. This enables the algorithm to make precise predictions or classifications when faced with fresh, unobserved data.
Examples:
     Regression: Predicting a continuous output (e.g., house prices based on features).
Classification: Assigning input data to predefined categories (e.g., spam email detection, image classification).
Teacher-Student Analogy: Think of supervised learning as a student learning from a teacher who corrects their predictions iteratively until acceptable performance is achieved.

Unsupervised Learning:

Definition: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm works with unlabelled data. There are no predefined output labels.
Objective: The focus is on discovering patterns, structures, or relationships within the data without explicit guidance.
Examples:
Clustering: Grouping similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation).
Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features while preserving essential information.
Pattern Recognition: Unsupervised learning identifies patterns without a predefined target attribute.
In summary:

Supervised learning relies on labelled data and aims for precise predictions.
Unsupervised learning explores data patterns without predefined output labels.
Both techniques play crucial roles in ML, depending on the problem.

5.DISCUSS THE IMPORTANCE OF INDENTATION IN PYTHON CODE?

A:Indentation is a fundamental aspect of Python programming, and its importance cannot be overstated. Let’s explore why indentation matters:

Syntax and Code Structure:
In Python, indentation is used to define code blocks. Unlike languages that use braces { }, Python relies on consistent indentation to group statements.
Proper indentation ensures that code is well-structured and easy to read.
Readability and Clarity:
Indentation enhances code readability. Well-indented code is like a well-organized book—it’s easier to follow and understand.
Clear indentation helps developers quickly identify the beginning and end of loops, conditionals, and function definitions.
Enforcing Consistency:
Python’s strict adherence to indentation promotes a uniform coding style.
When everyone follows the same indentation rules, code becomes more consistent across projects and teams.
Avoiding Syntax Errors:
Incorrect indentation can lead to IndentationError or unexpected behavior in your code.
The Python interpreter uses indentation to understand the grouping of statements.
Block Identification:
Each level of indentation represents a nested block of code.
Indentation helps indicate which statements belong to a specific loop, function, or conditional.
Code Maintainability:
Well-indented code is easier to maintain and modify.
When revisiting code, proper indentation allows you to quickly grasp its structure.

6.DIFINE A VARIABLE IN PYTHON.PROVIDE VALID EXAMPLES OF VALID VARIABLE NAMES?

A: In Python, a variable is a named storage location that holds a value. Here are the rules for defining valid variable names:

A variable name must start with a letter (uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore (_).
It cannot start with a number.
The rest of the variable name can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., myVar and MyVar are different variables).
Avoid using Python keywords (reserved words) as variable names (e.g., if, while, for, etc.).
Now, let’s look at some examples of valid variable names:

Valid Variable Names:
my_var
_count
total_volume
age
user_name
myVar
MYVAR
myVar2

Example: Variables Copy
num = 10 #integer variable
amount = 78.50 #float variable
greet='Hello World' #string variable
isActive = True #boolean variable

7.EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A KEYWORD AND AN IDENTIFIER IN PYTHON?

A:Keywords:
Definition: Keywords are reserved words in Python that have predefined meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, or class names).
Purpose: Keywords define the syntax and structure of the Python language.
Examples of Keywords

Keywords   


and:This is a logical operator which returns true if both the operands are true else returns false.
or:This is also a logical operator which returns true if anyone operand is true else returns false.
not:This is again a logical operator it returns True if the operand is false else returns false.
if:This is used to make a conditional statement.
elif:Elif is a condition statement used with an if statement. The elif statement is executed if the previous conditions were not true.
else:Else is used with if and elif conditional statements. The else block is executed if the given condition is not true.
for:This is used to create a loop.
while:This keyword is used to create a while loop.
break:This is used to terminate the loop.
as:This is used to create an alternative.
def:It helps us to define functions.
lambda:It is used to define the anonymous function.
pass:This is a null statement which means it will do nothing.
return:It will return a value and exit the function.
True:This is a boolean value.
False:This is also a boolean value.
try:It makes a try-except statement.
with:The with keyword is used to simplify exception handling.
assert:This function is used for debugging purposes. Usually used to check the correctness of code
class:It helps us to define a class.
continue:It continues to the next iteration of a loop
del:It deletes a reference to an object.
except:Used with exceptions, what to do when an exception occurs
finally:Finally is used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed no matter if there is an exception or not.
from:It is used to import specific parts of any module.
global:This declares a global variable.
import:This is used to import a module.
in:It’s used to check whether a value is present in a list, range, tuple, etc.
is:This is used to check if the two variables are equal or not.
none:This is a special constant used to denote a null value or avoid. It’s important to remember, 0, any empty container(e.g empty list) do not compute to None
nonlocal:It’s declared a non-local variable.
raise:This raises an exception.
yield:It ends a function and returns a generator.
async:It is used to create asynchronous coroutine.
await:It releases the flow of control back to the event loop.
The following code allows you to view the complete list of Python’s keywords.

This code imports the “keyword” module in Python and then prints a list of all the keywords in Python using the “kwlist” attribute of the “keyword” module. The “kwlist” attribute is a list of strings, where each string represents a keyword in Python. By printing this list, we can see all the keywords that are reserved in Python and cannot be used as identifiers.


# code
import keyword
 
print(keyword.kwlist)
Output
['False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'async', 'await', 'break', 'class', 'continue', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'finally', 'for', 'from', 'global', 'if', 'import', 'in', 'is',...

Identifiers in Python

Identifier is a user-defined name given to a variable, function, class, module, etc. The identifier is a combination of character digits and an underscore. They are case-sensitive i.e., ‘num’ and ‘Num’ and ‘NUM’ are three different identifiers in python. It is a good programming practice to give meaningful names to identifiers to make the code understandable.

We can also use the Python string isidentifier() method to check whether a string is a valid identifier or not.

Rules for Naming Python Identifiers
It cannot be a reserved python keyword.
It should not contain white space.
It can be a combination of A-Z, a-z, 0-9, or underscore.
It should start with an alphabet character or an underscore ( _ ).
It should not contain any special character other than an underscore ( _ ).
Examples of Python Identifiers
Valid identifiers:

var1
_var1
_1_var
var_1
Invalid Identifiers

!var1
1var
1_var
var#1
var 1
Python Keywords and Identifiers Examples
Example 1: Example of and, or, not, True, False keywords.


print("example of True, False, and, or, not keywords")
 
#  compare two operands using and operator
print(True and True)
 
# compare two operands using or operator
print(True or False)
 
# use of not operator
print(not False)
Output
example of True, False, and, or, not keywords
True
True
True

Example 2: Example of a break, continue keywords and identifier.


# execute for loop
for i in range(1, 11):
     
    # print the value of i
    print(i)
     
    # check the value of i is less than 5
    # if i lessthan 5 then continue loop
    if i < 5:  

        continue
         
    # if i greater than 5 then break loop
    else:  
        break
Output

8Q.LIST THE BASIC DATA TYPES  AVAILABLE IN PYTHON?

A: there are several basic data types that you can use to represent different kinds of values. Let’s explore them:

Integers (int):
Integers represent whole numbers (positive, negative, or zero).
Examples: 10, -42, 0.
Floating-Point Numbers (float):
Floating-point numbers represent decimal or fractional values.
Examples: 3.14, -0.5, 2.718.
Complex Numbers (complex):
Complex numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part.
Written as a + bj, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part.
Example: 3 + 2j.
Booleans (bool):
Booleans represent truth values (True or False).
Used for logical operations and control flow.
Example: True.
Strings (str):
Strings represent sequences of characters.
Enclosed in single (') or double (") quotes.
Example: 'Hello, World!'.

9Q.DESCRIBE THE SYNTAX FOR AN IF STATEMENT IN PYTHON?

A: the if statement is used for conditional execution. It allows you to execute a block of code only if a specific condition is met. Here’s the basic syntax for an if statement:

Python

if condition:
    # Body of the if statement
    # This code executes if the condition is True
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
The condition is an expression that evaluates to either True or False.
If the condition is True, the indented code block under the if statement is executed.
If the condition is False, the indented code block is skipped.
Example:

Python

number = 10
if number > 0:
    print('Number is positive')
print('This statement always executes')
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Output:

Number is positive
This statement always executes

In the example above:

The condition number > 0 evaluates to True because number is greater than 0.
Therefore, the body of the if statement (the print('Number is positive') line) executes.

10Q.EXPLAIN THE PURPOSE OF THE ELIF STATEMENT IN PYTHON?

A:elif statement in Python serves as an essential part of the if-else structure. It allows you to handle multiple conditions sequentially. Think of it as a combination of “else” and “if”, which can be read as “else if”. Here’s why it’s useful:

Sequential Condition Checking:
When you have multiple conditions to evaluate, the elif statement lets you check them one after another.
It provides an efficient way to make decisions based on various possibilities.
Execution Based on the First True Condition:
Python evaluates each elif condition in order.
As soon as it finds a true condition, it executes the corresponding block of code associated with that condition.
If none of the elif conditions are true, the else block (if present) is executed.
Example:
Python

temperature = 25

if temperature < 0:
    print("It's freezing!")
elif 0 <= temperature < 10:
    print("It's cold.")
elif 10 <= temperature < 20:
    print("It's cool.")
else:
    print("It's warm.")

In this example, Python checks the temperature range sequentially.
Since temperature is 25, the condition 10 <= temperature < 20 evaluates to true, so the corresponding message (“It’s cool.”) is printed.
